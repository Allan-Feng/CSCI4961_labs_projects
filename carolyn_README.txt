IBM Grover's Algorithm for one solution comparison to reimplementation of IBM Grover's Algorithm for multiple solution
The plot distribution shows all the possible bitstring solutions, with one bitstring (100)at a higher quasi probability at 0.478, concluding that the solution is 100


IBM Grover's Algorithm for one solution
The plot distribution shows all the possible bitstring solutions, however with two outlier bitstrings (100, and 001) at a higher probability than the rest
The quasi probability of the bitstring 100 is 0.325 which is 0.053 less than with one solution
The quasi probability of the bitstring 001 is 0.286 which is 0.168 more than with one solution
