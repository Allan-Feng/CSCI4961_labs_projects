# Intermediate Modules: Algorithms

Welcome to the **Algorithms** folder! This section contains intermediate modules that explore quantum algorithms, designed to deepen understanding of how quantum computing can solve problems more efficiently than classical approaches.

## Structure

The structure of the folders follows the Intermediate modules (Algorithms) section of the [Roadmap](https://github.com/YangletLiu/CSCI4961_labs_projects/blob/main/README.md) on the main repository page. <br> Each topic includes the corresponding Jupyter notebook and any required images for the notebook.
