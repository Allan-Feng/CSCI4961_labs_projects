# Advanced Modules: Applications

Welcome to the **Applications** folder! This section contains advanced modules that:
- Demonstrate the practical impact of quantum computing by solving real-world problems
- Take quantum-inspired approaches to real-world problems
- Enhance current quantum computing technology

## Structure

The structure of the folders follows the Advanced modules (Applications) section of the [Roadmap](https://github.com/YangletLiu/CSCI4961_labs_projects/blob/main/README.md) on the main repository page. <br> Each topic includes the corresponding Jupyter notebook, any required images, and any needed data for the notebook.
