# Quantum Education Modules

Welcome to the **Modules** folder! This folder is organized into three key sections to provide a structured approach to learning quantum computing:

1. **Concepts**: Quantum computing concepts.
2. **Algorithms**: Quantum algorithms.
3. **Applications**: Real-world use cases and domain-specific applications of quantum computing.

## Structure

The structure of the modules follows the [Roadmap](https://github.com/YangletLiu/CSCI4961_labs_projects/blob/main/README.md) on the main repository page. 
<br> Each topic includes their corresponding Jupyter notebooks and any required images for each notebook.

## How to Use

Each module is designed to supplement course lectures as practical labs/projects. You will need to download the Jupyter notebooks on your local machine by either cloning our GitHub repository or downloading the raw file. 

Alternatively, you can go to our documentation [website](https://csci4961-labs-projects.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to view the cells already pre-run. However, you will not be able to re-run or modify them.
