# Introductory Modules: Concepts

Welcome to the **Concepts** folder! This folder contains introductory modules that cover fundamental quantum computing concepts and serve as the building blocks for more advanced topics.

## Structure

The structure of the folders follows the Introductory modules (Concepts) section of the [Roadmap](https://github.com/YangletLiu/CSCI4961_labs_projects/blob/main/README.md) on the main repository page. <br> Each topic includes the corresponding Jupyter notebook and any required images for the notebook.
