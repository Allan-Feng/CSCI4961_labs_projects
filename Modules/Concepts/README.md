# Introductory Modules: Concepts

Welcome to the **Concepts** folder! This folder contains introductory modules that cover fundamental quantum computing concepts and serve as the building blocks for more advanced topics.

### Current Structure

The current structure of the folders follows the Introductory modules (Concepts) section of the [Roadmap](https://github.com/YangletLiu/CSCI4961_labs_projects/blob/main/README.md) on the main repository page. <br> Each topic includes the corresponding Jupyter notebook and any required images for the notebook.

## How to Use

Each module is designed to supplement course lectures as practical labs/projects. You will need to download the Jupyter notebooks on your local machine by either cloning our GitHub repository or downloading the raw file. 

Alternatively, you can go to our documentation [website](https://csci4961-labs-projects.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to view the cells already pre-run. However, you will not be able to re-run or modify them.
