# Labs and Projects of CSCI4961 Introduction to Quantum Computing

## Overview

Starting from the course CSCI 4961 Introduction to quantum computing, the project provides a comprehensive set of >20 tutorial for implementating quantum algorithms. For example, Grover’s search algorithm, Shor’s algorithm, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Quantum Neural Networks, etc. We will demonstrate practical implementations of these algorithms using Qiskit codes and testing them on IBM System One on RPI Campus. Our aim is to promote the understanding and applications of quantum computing for both educational and research purposes.

## Final Deliverables

### Qiskit codes for quantum algorithms 
### Well-documented Jupyter notebook files
### Testings on IBM System One on RPI Campus
### Reports highlighting performance of the codes
