# CSCI4961 Introduction to Quantum Computing: Labs and Projects

## Overview

For the course CSCI 4961 Introduction to quantum computing, the project provides a comprehensive set of >20 tutorials forimplementating quantum algorithms. For example, Grover’s search algorithm, Shor’s algorithm, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Quantum Neural Networks, etc. We demonstrate practical implementations of these algorithms using Qiskit codes and testing them on IBM System One on RPI Campus. Our aim is to promote the understanding and applications of quantum computing for both educational and research purposes.

## Final Deliverables

### Qiskit codes for quantum algorithms 
### Well-documented Jupyter notebook files
### Testings on IBM System One on RPI Campus
### Reports highlighting performance of the codes


## Roadmap

### Short Term Goals 

1. **Implementation of top 3 quantum algorithms**
    - Grover's Algorithm

### Timeline (9/24/2024 - 12/10/2024)

1. Grover's Algorithm: October 22, 2024
    - Research various implementations of Grover’s algorithms
    - Design or collect multiple datasets for a search space
    - Begin with smaller sets using less qubits (~10 potential solutions), working up to larger ones (50-100 potential solutions)
2. Shor's Algorithm: November 14, 2024
    - Research various implementations of Shor’s algorithms
    - Test the implementation on specific integer factorization problems
    - Verify the results
3. QAOA: December 10, 2024
    - Research various implementations of QAOA algorithms
    - Test the implementation for solving a Max Cut problem
    - Verify the results
