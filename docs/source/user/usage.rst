How to Use
==========

Our modular structure has made it easy to navigate through the modules. Each module is designed to be self-contained, with a clear learning objective. 
For integration with courses, you will be able to choose any subset of modules to use as labs or projects to supplement your course material.

An example of this would be using the Common Gates module as a lab to introduce students to visual representations of quantum gates and their effects on qubits through the IBM Quantum Composer. 
This hands-on approach will complement the theoretical understanding of quantum gates as unitary matrices applied to qubits.
