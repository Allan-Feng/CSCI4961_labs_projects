Description
===========
Welcome to `Quantum Education Modules <https://github.com/YangletLiu/CSCI4961_labs_projects>`_! 

`Quantum Education Modules <https://github.com/YangletLiu/CSCI4961_labs_projects>`_ is an open source hands-on modular approach centered around labs and projects, designed to supplement theory through engagement in guided practical experiments using Jupyter notebooks and RPI's IBM Quantum System One. 

Through these modules, we provide:

- Adaptability for interdisciplinary education: Each module can be seamlessly adopted into different courses.
- Flexible learning paths: Modular structure allows a new course to simply choose a subset of modules for a smooth learning path.
- Detailed tutorials and manuals: Each module includes a detailed tutorial to guide students through the experiments.

Motivation
==========
The emerging field of quantum computing offers the opportunity for new career paths, research, and collaboration. However, the complexity of quantum computing can be a barrier to entry for students and educators.
Our goal is to make quantum computing more accessible and engaging for a broader audience. 

We hope to facilitate the process of creating new quantum courses by integrating this modular approach into current and future quantum course offerings, accelerating the development of practical quantum computing skills and advancing the educational landscape for emerging quantum technologies.
