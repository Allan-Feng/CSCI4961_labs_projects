Superposition
=============
.. Classically, a bit can either be :math:`0` or :math:`1`, never both simultaneously. Quantum bits (qubits) exist in a state of superposition, meaning they can represent both :math:`0` or :math:`1` simulatenously.
.. This is described mathematically as:

.. :math:`\ket{\psi} = \alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}`

.. where :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` are complex coefficients, and :math:`\ket{\psi}` is the qubit state.
