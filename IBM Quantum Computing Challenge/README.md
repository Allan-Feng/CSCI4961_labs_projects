# IBM Quantum Challenge 2024

From June 5th, 2024 to July 14th, 2024 (7/5/2024-7/14/2024), students worked on a series of labs about using Qiskit SDK 1.0 to work towards utility-scale quantum experiments. They learned to appropriately map, optimize, execute, and process quantum circuits via Qiskit 1.0. Our students communicated with each other and with participants around the world to tackle the challenge, acquiring essential skills in interacting with quantum hardware.
